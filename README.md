Authentification Security assignement.


This is a small task to secure a website by adding Authentification. 

The guide I used to make this was "https://spring.io/guides/gs/securing-web/" 
By following the instruction steps by steps I was able to create this small page where when you login you can see a Hello user!, sign out and sign in.
